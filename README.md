"# DuckSightingApp" 
This project was completed as a preliminary assignment for a summer intership at Vincit.

You can find the code for the server at https://github.com/Vincit/summer-2018/ 

I had no previous experience working with node.js servers, or JSON values so this project taught me a lot of new things, and overall was a nice and valuable experience.
